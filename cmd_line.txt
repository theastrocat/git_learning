	Definitions:

Directory		: A folder

Current Directory	: Which folder you are in.

~ 			: Root directory, this is the lowest level (ish) of your system.

.			: System notation for current directory.

..			: System notation for "UP" one directory.


	Commands:

pwd: "Print Working Directory" prints the location of where you are to the screen eg:

	$ pwd
	/c/Users/bmcadams/Documents/

ls		: "List" lists items (folders and files) in current directory.

ls folder	: lists the items in "folder" if "folder" is in your Current Directory

cd folder	: "Change Directory" Changes the directory to "folder" if "folder" is in the directory.

explorer .	: Opens the current directory in the file explorer.




	Notes:

Some commands can be chained together, like changing directories. For example:

	bmcadams@bmcadams MINGW64 /c/Users
	$ pwd
	/c/Users

	bmcadams@bmcadams MINGW64 /c/Users
	$ cd bmcadams/Documents/

	bmcadams@bmcadams MINGW64 ~/Documents
	$ pwd
	/c/Users/bmcadams/Documents


Changing directories back to where I was (using .. because that is UP one directory):

	bmcadams@bmcadams MINGW64 ~/Documents
	$ pwd
	/c/Users/bmcadams/Documents

	bmcadams@bmcadams MINGW64 ~/Documents
	$ cd ../../

	bmcadams@bmcadams MINGW64 /c/Users
	$ pwd
	/c/Users
